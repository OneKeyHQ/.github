#### 🗳️ Your crypto, in your hands

OneKey will not store your private keys or recovery seed, all our hardware and software are open source.

#### 👶 Simple yet secure

Use the OneKey App by itself or with the hardware, keeping it simple for beginners without compromising on security.

#### 👁️ Truly open source

Open source means that we don't hide any code and are open to inspection by everyone, which takes courage and commitment.

#### 🔐 End-to-end encryption

OneKey uses industry-leading encryption technology to store your information locally. Only you can decrypt that information.
