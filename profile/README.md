#### 🗳️ Your cryptos, only in your hands

OneKey will not store your private key or recovery seed, and all the hardware and software we made are open source.

#### 👶 Safety does not mean trouble

Use OneKey App alone or with hardware, keeping cryptos made so easy for beginners.

#### 👁️ Open source, really

Open source means that we don't hide any code and are open to inspection by everyone, which takes courage and commitment.

#### 🔐 End-to-end encryption

OneKey uses industry-leading encryption technology to store your information locally. Only you can decrypt the information.
